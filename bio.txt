Hello my name is Lucas Yi. I am currently a student studying application development 
through a program called Year Up. Last year, I utilized my time by learning and creating an 
ecommerce business. While managing an ecommerce business, I have gained strong problem 
solving, web development, and customer service skills. I would love to expand and strengthen 
my knowledge in a tech company as a project manager
